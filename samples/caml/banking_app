Set color of button LoginBtn to "blue" $ Background color
Set border color of button LoginBtn to "#333333"
Set text color of button LoginBtn to "white"

# --- 4. Logic/Function (Placeholder for button action) ---
Define function 'OnLoginClick' which does:
    interact "Enter username:"
    interact "Enter password:"
    $ If statements would go here to check credentials

# (A real Caml program would need syntax to attach OnLoginClick to LoginBtn)
# For the sake of syntax demonstration, we stop here.
